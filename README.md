# 🎬 AI Movie Recommendation System  

This project is part of an **Artificial Intelligence** coursework, focusing on **Recommendation Systems** for movies. The goal is to build a system that suggests movies based on **both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering**.  

## 🚀 Features  

### 🎞️ Movie Recommendation System  
- Uses **metadata features** such as genre, director, actors, and keywords to recommend movies.  
- Implements **collaborative filtering**, which leverages user rating data to provide personalized recommendations.  
- Uses **IMDB-like movie datasets** with real user ratings.  

### 🔍 Data Sources  
- `movies_metadata.csv`: Contains metadata about movies (e.g., genre, director, keywords).  
- `ratings.csv`: Contains real user ratings, divided into train and test sets.  

### 📊 Machine Learning & AI Methods  
- **Content-Based Filtering**:  
  - Uses **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** and **Cosine Similarity** to recommend movies based on descriptions.  
- **Collaborative Filtering**:  
  - Implements **User-Based and Item-Based Similarity** approaches.  
  - Utilizes **Matrix Factorization techniques (e.g., SVD, ALS)** for recommendation.  
- **Hybrid Models**:  
  - Combines **both content-based and collaborative filtering** for more accurate recommendations.
